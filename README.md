# Simulation.js

Simulation.js is a simple JavaScript library for making graphics in the html canvas.

To run locally

```
npm i
npm start
```

`simulation.js` and minified file are located in dist directory

### Notes

- depending on the position of the center of a square,
  the scale method may not scale the shape, but instead translate
  and shrink it.
- some transition functions override the component values of
  other animations, and may not work together (probably ([{(maybe)}]))
